# Tabs, Headers, Footers, Page Numbers, Reviewing, Images, and Charts

Word has an extensive set of features.

In this chapter we will focus on features that will give you more control over how your document is displayed as well as the quality of the content that you include.

<br>

## Indenting and Tabs

Indenting text adds structure to your document by allowing you to separate information.

#### Tab keys

A quick way to indent is to use the **Tab** key. This will create a first-line indent of **1/2 inch**.

* Place the insertion point **at the very beginning** of the paragraph you want to indent, and press the **Tab** key.
* On the Ruler, you should see the **first-line indent marker** move to the right by **1/2 inch**.
* If you can't see the Ruler, select the **View** tab, then click the checkbox next to the **Ruler**.

Word provides **indent markers** that allow you to indent paragraphs to the location you want.

- **Hanging indent marker** ![hanging indent](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/tabs_inline_hanging.png ':class=inline-img') adjusts the hanging indent


- **Left indent marker** ![left indent](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/tabs_inline_left_indent.png ':class=inline-img') moves **both** the first-line indent and hanging indent markers at the same time (indenting all lines in a paragraph)


#### Indent markers

* Place the insertion point anywhere in the paragraph you want to indent, or select one or more paragraphs.
* Click and drag the desired **indent marker**.

#### Indent commands

* Place the insertion point anywhere in the paragraph you want to indent.

* On the **Home** tab, click the **Increase Indent** or **Decrease Indent** command.

* The Indent commands will adjust the indent by **1/2-inch increments**, but it is customizable.

* To customize the indent amounts, select the **Layout** tab near the desired values in the boxes under **Indent**.

#### Tab Stops

Adding **tab stops** to the **Ruler** allows you to change the size of the tabs, and Word even allows you to apply more than one tab stop to a single line. For example, on a resume you could **left-align** the beginning of a line and **right-align** the end of the line by adding a **Right Tab**.

The **tab selector** is located above the **vertical ruler** on the left. Hover the mouse over the tab selector to see the name of the active **tab stop**.

### Types of Tab stops

- **Left Tab** ![left tab stop](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/2016-01-07_15-39-27.png ':class=inline-img') left-aligns the text at the tab stop

- **Center Tab** ![center tab stop](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/tabs_inline_center.png ':class=inline-img') centers the text around the tab stop

- **Right Tab** ![right tab stop](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/2016-01-05_16-20-24.png ':class=inline-img') right-aligns the text at the tab stop

- **Decimal Tab** ![decimal tab](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/2016-01-05_16-21-10.png ':class=inline-img') aligns decimal numbers using the decimal point

- **Bar Tab** ![bar tab](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/2016-01-05_16-22-04.png ':class=inline-img') draws a vertical line on the document

- **First Line Indent** ![first line indent](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/tabs_inline_first.png ':class=inline-img') inserts the indent marker on the Ruler and indents the first line of text in a paragraph

- **Hanging Indent** ![hanging indent](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/tabs_inline_hanging.png ':class=inline-img') inserts the hanging indent marker and indents all lines other than the first line

#### Removing tab stops

It's a good idea to remove any tab stops you aren't using so they don't get in the way. To remove a tab stop, first select all of the text that uses the tab stop. Then click and drag it off of the Ruler.

</br>

Word can also display hidden formatting symbols such as spaces (![space symbol](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/2016-01-07_15-35-18.png  ':class=inline-img')), paragraph marks (![paragraph mark](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/2016-01-07_15-33-33.png  ':class=inline-img')), and tabs (![tab symbol](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/568c17f98d7fa91e7c8d89a9_01_05_2016/2016-01-07_15-34-56.png  ':class=inline-img')) to help you see the formatting in your document. To show hidden formatting symbols, select the **Home** tab, then click the **Show/Hide** command.

### Design tab options

When your document's header and footer are unlocked, the **Design** tab will appear on the right side of the Ribbon, giving you various editing options:

* Hide the first-page header and footer
* Remove the header or footer
* Page Number
* Additional options: With the commands available in the Insert group, you can add the  date and time, document info, pictures, and more to your header or footer.

<br>

## Insert page numbers

1. Select **Insert** > **Page Number**, and then choose the location and style you want.
2. If you don't want a page number to appear on the first page, select **Different First Page**.
3. If you want numbering to start with 1 on the second page, go to **Page Number** > **Format Page Numbers**, and set **Start at** to **0**.
4. When you're done, select **Close Header and Footer** or press Esc.

<br>

## Grammar & Spelling

Microsoft Editor analyzes your document and offers suggestions for spelling, grammar, and stylistic issues. To use Editor, on the **Home** tab choose **Editor**.

### Reviewing suggestions

* Choose a correction or refinement type, then use the arrows near the top of the pane to step through each of that type of issue.

* Choose a suggestion to incorporate it into your document. If you don't like the suggestion, choose **Ignore Once**. Or, if you never want this type of suggestion, choose **Don't check for this issue**.

By default, Editor checks for several categories of issues. To modify tune Editor for suggestions you want, do the following:

* In the Editor pane, choose **Settings**.
* In the Word Options dialog box, next to **Grammar & Refinements**, choose **Settings**.
* Scroll through the list of options. Select issues you want Editor to check, and clear the issues you want Editor to ignore.
* Choose **OK**.

        1. **Layout Options**
           Choose how your object interacts with the text around it.
        2. **Chart Elements**
           Add, remove, or change chart elements such as the title, legend, gridlines, and data labels.
        3. **Chart Styles**
           Set a style and color scheme for your chart.
        4. **Chart Filters**
