# Error bars

-   Error bars in charts display margins of error and standard deviations.
    
-   They can be shown on all data points in a series as a **standard error amount,** **a percentage**, or **a standard deviation**.
    
-   Error bars can be added in 2-D area, bar, column, line, xy (scatter), and bubble charts. In scatter and bubble charts, you can show error bars for x and y values.
    

To add or remove error bars:

1.  Click anywhere in the chart.
    
2.  Click the **Chart Elements** button + next to the chart, and then check the **Error Bars** box.
    
3.  To change the error amount shown, click the arrow next to **Error Bars**, and then pick an option.
