# Collaborating: Comments & Changes

An important aspect of collaborating effectively is providing comments and change suggestions to someone's document.

In this section we will look at how to add comments to a Word document as well as how to suggest non-permanent edits and how to invite others to co-edit.

## Choose the Markup View

It's possible to select what kind of suggestion markup will be shown.

For example, you may choose to show:

-   **Original:** Only the original text without any suggestions or comments;
    
-   **No Markup:** To show what the text will look like if all suggested changed were incorporated.
