# Charts

### Chart types

There are several **types of charts** in Excel.

-   **Column**: Uses vertical bars to represent data. Used to compare information.
    
-   **Line**: Data points are connected with lines. Used to show trends in data (increasing or decreasing)
    
-   **Pie**: Each value is a slice of the pie. Used to compare proportions.
    
-   **Bar**: Similar to column chart, but horizontal rather than vertical.
    
-   **Area**: Similar to line charts except area under the line is filled.
    
-   **Surface**: Displays data in a 3D landscape. Best for large data sets. Allows you to see a variety of information at the same time.
    

### Chart parts

-   Chart Title: Describes what the chart is illustrating.
    
-   Horizontal Axis: x-axis

**Keeping charts up to date:**

When you add more data to your spreadsheet, the chart may not include the new data.

To fix this, you can adjust the [**data range**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1osBWySSvk&t=2s).

1.  Click the chart, and it will highlight the data range in your spreadsheet.
    
2.  You can then click and drag the **handle** in the lower-right corner to change the data range.
