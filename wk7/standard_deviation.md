# Standard Deviation

## Standard Deviation

When measuring things we can often notice trends and patterns.

When naturally occurring measurements happens mostly around one central value, we can measure how spread out values are from this central "peak".

> Standard deviation is a measure of spread around a central value.
>
> In other words, it is a "distance" from an average value.

### Standard Deviation in Excel

Excel has multiple build-in equation for calculating the standard deviation:

- **STDEV.P** - Standard Deviation on a Population
  - Used when every single element is included in your data
    - Eg. Stats Canada census since everyone has to do it.
- **STDEV.S** - Standard Deviation on a Sample
  - Used when you only have data for a sub-set of total data.
    - Eg. Taking a few tables from a production line.



> Most of the time we are working with Standard Deviation on a sample since we rarely have access to the entire data set.
